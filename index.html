        <h1> Hello, my name is Prinsa, today I am going to tell you about my hobby which is reading Dork Diaries. </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I like to read Dork Diaries because I love to read, I can read anytime at any moment! A thing you can do is read with friends, och have different books where you finish reading them you give one for another instead of reading the same one over and over, but you have to tae care of the books. The more you read the more exciting it gets! It has little doodles and is like someones diary that you are reading! Me and my friends have an online reading contest and we have the timer for 10 minutes and whoever goes the furthest wins! We also do some little quizzes and try to copy the doodles!</p>
